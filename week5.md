## Call Management:
Implement a system where calls can be recorded and tied to cases automatically to streamline the process.
Allow admins to log cases directly during calls, improving efficiency.
## Role Table Structure:
Consider designing a more flexible role management system, possibly using a role hierarchy or permission sets, to differentiate between admin, user manager, and agent roles more clearly.
Create a dedicated roles table in the database to manage permissions and responsibilities efficiently.
## Admin and User Management:
Increase the number of admin roles to handle a higher volume of cases, ensuring that workloads are distributed evenly.
Allow user managers to oversee agents and manage case assignments effectively.
## Account Creation:
Enable admins to create new accounts directly through the database interface, simplifying the onboarding process for new agents.
## Design and User Interface:
Focus on user-friendly design and styles that enhance the user experience.
Implement intuitive navigation and visually appealing layouts to make the system more engaging.
## Role Management:
Develop a robust role management system that allows for easy assignment of roles and permissions.
Ensure that managers can view and track cases assigned to their team members, promoting accountability and oversight.
## Case Tracking:
Implement a feature where managers can view cases created by their team, along with details like timestamps and status updates.
Consider adding a dashboard for managers that visualizes their team's performance metrics.
## Client Feedback Simulation:
Create a realistic client feedback interface that mimics real-world scenarios, allowing users to interact with the system in a way that reflects actual case handling.
Solicit ongoing feedback from users to refine the system further based on their experiences.
